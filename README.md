* Account group management
* Server farm security management (key management, access monitoring ...)
* Server farm definition via a CSV database (edit via spreadsheet, standard editor ...)
* and more cool stuff ... Cf command overview screenshot

User documentation is still in translation.

* Execute : tar xf cls*.tar.gz
* Enjoy !
